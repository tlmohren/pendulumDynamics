# Pendulum dynamics
This folder contains a script to simulate a pendulum with non-zero leg mass.

The folder contains two files:
- pendulum_simulation.ipynb
- pendulum_animation.mp4


### pendulum_simulation.ipynb
This is a jupyter notebook containing code that calculates the swing time of a pendulum and that computes the trajectory. It outputs an animation file.

To run it, you will require python with several packages to be installed on your computer. To see it's output however, just requires clicking on the file on github's website. If it doesn't show right away, press reload (sometimes github has difficulty displaying it).

### pendulum_animation.mp4
To view this, click on the file. In the next window there will be a 'download' button (next to 'history'). That will initiate the ownload of a roughly 1Mb animation,
